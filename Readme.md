* Tracks can have a default fade in time. It will overwrite any existing fade time on playlists.
* New buttons to pause/start/forward/rewind all currently played tracks
* Double click on a song in a playlist starts to play the sound
* Drag playlists to the hotbar to create a play playlist macro. The macro will stop all other playlists and crossfade to the selected playlist. Moreover it'll show some quick buttons to handle playlists better
